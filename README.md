This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for working with Anthropic Large Language Models (LLMs), providing tools to explore chat-based interactions, retrieval-augmented generation, and text generation. These notebooks serve as a practical introduction to leveraging Anthropic models for various applications.

## Repository Structure

- **[ANTHROPIC-CHATBOT.ipynb](https://github.com/simonpierreboucher/llm_anthropic_notebook/blob/main/ANTHROPIC-CHATBOT.ipynb)**: Demonstrates how to set up and run a chatbot using an Anthropic model, focusing on conversational flow and responsive dialogue management.
- **[ANTHROPIC-RAG.ipynb](https://github.com/simonpierreboucher/llm_anthropic_notebook/blob/main/ANTHROPIC-RAG.ipynb)**: Implements Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), where the model retrieves relevant information from a predefined source before generating responses. Ideal for Q&A systems and other information-based applications.
- **[ANTHROPIC-TEXTGEN.ipynb](https://github.com/simonpierreboucher/llm_anthropic_notebook/blob/main/ANTHROPIC-TEXTGEN.ipynb)**: Explores the text generation capabilities of Anthropic models, allowing for creative and informative text output.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run these notebooks, you will need:
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

Install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Notebooks

1. **Start Jupyter Notebook**: Navigate to the repository folder and launch Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. **Select a Notebook**: Open any of the notebooks to explore chatbot interactions, RAG, or text generation.
3. **Follow Instructions**: Each notebook contains specific setup steps and instructions for interacting with the model.

## Use Cases

- **ANTHROPIC-CHATBOT**: Ideal for building conversational agents or virtual assistants.
- **ANTHROPIC-RAG**: Suitable for applications needing fact-based responses, such as customer support and knowledge retrieval.
- **ANTHROPIC-TEXTGEN**: Perfect for content generation, story creation, or any task requiring flexible text output.
